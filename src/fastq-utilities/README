fastqAnalyze.mk
 - converted older illumina fastq to sanger style qvs
 - reported stats on qv values
 - nothing of interest here

fastqSample.mk
 - samples paired reads
   - by desired coverage
   - by desired number of pairs
   - by desired fraction of input
   - by desired number of bases in output
 - obsolete EXCEPT for handling of paired reads


fastqSimulate-sort.mk
 - parses fastqSimulate name lines to determine contig ID and position, then
   outputs reads in increasing order

fastqSimulate.mk
 - generated single/paired-end/mated reads from input sequences
 - supported generating junction and chimeric reads


worth keeping fastqSample and fastqSimulate to isolate PE/MP/chimer support
simulate wouldn't be too hard to put into 'sequence'.
sample probably would be (need to track two files, etc).
 - heh, it's already got a '-paired' mode!!
