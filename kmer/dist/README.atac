Helpful hints on how to run ATAC, aka, A2Amapper
 -or-
How I couldn't get the build system to do what I wanted.



COMPILING and INSTALLING
------------------------

If you are very lucky, you can simply do:

% sh configure.sh
% gmake
% cd atac-driver
% sh install.sh <location-to-install>

However, when gmake complains or crashes, you'll need to build a
patched gmake.  Instructions for doing this are in
build/patches/README.
