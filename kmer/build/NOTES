This is a prottypical build system for non-recursive whole-directory
makes.  This readme file is going to start you with the basics.

gmake-3.80+
The correct make to use if gmake.  The correct version of gmake to use
is gmake-3.80 with the GNU accepted patch for this problem
  http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=1517&group_id=71
Patched source can be found around here somewhere.  Find Ross.

On the AIX and Tru64 machines, a patched version of gmake-3.80 called
'gmake-3.80a' exists and should be in /usr/local/ir/bin.

So to get started
% alias make=/usr/local/ir/bin/gmake-3.80a

To make all targets
% make all

Local targets are supported:
To make all of RASCAL
% make ../RASCAL/.all

To make and install the binaries and libs of Framework
% make ../COMPASS/src/Framework/.install

Other targets supported are clean, depends-clean, real-clean.

If you either change platforms then you must do
% make real-clean

For convenience:
% make ls
just does ls of all targets in the directories where they are built.
