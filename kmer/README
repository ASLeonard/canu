This is a collection of codes written/supported by Brian Walenz
(Informatics Research).  All codes are intertwined, hence the grouping
under BRI/ instead of ESTmapper/ and emma/ and meryl/ and etc.


Applications included here are:


ESTmapper / snapper
-------------------
massive cDNA and SNP tag mapping.  Includes sim4dbseq.


emma
----
Exact Mer MAtches, an exact search mechanism for mapping k-mer tags to
sequence


meryl
-----
The (magic) mer counter


----------------------------------------

How to build:

Unfortunately, I don't really use the IR standard build system.  There
is a better way to do this, but I know this way works.

ln -s ../build/Make.path
ln -s ../build/Make.rules
ln -s ../build/Make_utils
ln -s ../build/Makefile

You might have to
  cd ../build/Make_utils && cc -o makepath makepath.c

setenv WITH_THREADS yes
alias mbri gmake -f /IR/devel/mapping/cds/IR/BRI/Makefile
alias mbri gmake -f /work/cds/IR//BRI/Makefile

sh ./configure.sh

Then, in cds/IR/BRI, mbri to build the stuff and
cd ESTmapper && mbri to make ESTmapper.

In theory, you can build out of ../build, but I don't do that.
Clark Mobarry does, so check with him.
