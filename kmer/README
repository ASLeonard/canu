This is a collection of codes written/supported by Brian Walenz
(Informatics Research).  All codes are intertwined, hence the grouping
under BRI/ instead of ESTmapper/ and emma/ and meryl/ and etc.

----------------------------------------

How to build:

If you haven't already, you need to check out cds/IR/build.
Documentation for the build system is in cds/IR/build/doc.

----------
1)  Create machine dependent configuration files.

% sh configure.sh

If it reports that your architecture is unsupported, you'll have to
port.  Supplying 'debug' as an argument will build debug versions.
Good luck!

----------
2)  Build

Most of the tools here use pthreads.

% gmake

If this crashes or returns
        gmake: *** No rule to make target `.all', needed by `all'.  Stop.
then you unfortunately need to update your gmake.  Instructions for
doing this are in cds/IR/build/patches/README

----------
3)  Install things, other build targets

A 'make install' will copy all the executables into a 'bin' directory
in cds/IR/BRI/bin.

To install ESTmapper, 'cd ESTmapper && make -f ../Makefile'.
ESTmapper is now installed in cds/IR/BRI/ESTmapper, and you can copy
it wherever.

----------
4)  Other build targets

A 'make clean' will remove the object files, leaving the binaries.

A 'make real-clean' will remove all traces of a build, leaving you
with only a few files more than a freshly checked out copy.
