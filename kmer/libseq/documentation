Classes

seqFile    -- base class for all sequence file accessor classes.

sffFile    -- accessor for SFF files
fastaFile  -- accessor for fasta files
seqStore   -- accessor for kmer binary sequence files
gkpStore   -- accessor for CA gatekeeper stores (in CA code base)

seqFactory -- Opens files, returns a seqFile.  Used by
              seqCache and seqStream.

seqInCore  -- a sequence object, in memory
seqOnDisk  -- a sequence object, on disk

seqCache   -- loads sequences from accessors, returns seqInCore or
              seqOnDisk, optionally caches seqInCore for later use

seqStream  -- provides a character stream (ala getchar()) of the
              backing file accessor.  Sequences separated by multiple
              '.' characters.  ID of sequence and position in
              sequence are known.

merStream  -- provides a mer stream from a seqStream.

ACCESSOR CLASSES are not for general use!  Use:
